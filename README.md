# WFP
This page is meant for information about the WFP hackathon. See http://www.datamission.nl/un-world-food-program-hackathon/ for more info

More info right now, is in the wiki: https://github.com/datamission/WFP/wiki.

But scripts to read the different datasets will be put here eventually (probably in a datasets directory).
