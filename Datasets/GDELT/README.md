The SQL form allows you to select events in one single country, as in https://github.com/mattiaf/WFP/blob/master/OtherData/GDELT/GDELT.ipynb

The possible idea is that in 3rd world countries a large number of events correlates with a crisis, therefore possibly with hunger.

Unfortunately it's not straight-forward to select only events relevant to the context. This is the code they use to categorize events: http://gdeltproject.org/data/lookups/CAMEO.eventcodes.txt
